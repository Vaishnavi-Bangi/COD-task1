description: 
This calculator program is a straightforward Java application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations through a console interface. It encompasses two primary classes: `BasicCalc` and `Calci`, both housed within the `com.codtech` package.

### Class: BasicCalc

The `BasicCalc` class serves as the backbone, containing methods to execute the fundamental arithmetic operations:

1. **addition(double a, double b)**: Returns the sum of two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. **subtraction(double a, double b)**: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.
3. **multiplication(double a, double b)**: Computes the product of `a` and `b`.
4. **division(double a, double b)**: Provides the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.
5. **modulus(double a, double b)**: Offers the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

### Class: Calci

The `Calci` class extends `BasicCalc`, acting as the entry point for the program. It orchestrates user interaction via the console, facilitating input and displaying results:

1. **User Input**: Utilizes a `Scanner` object to capture user-provided numerical inputs and the desired arithmetic operation.
2. **Operation Selection**: Allows users to choose among addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or modulus.
3. **Switch Statement**: Implements a switch-case construct to execute the chosen operation using methods inherited from `BasicCalc`.
4. **Output Display**: Presents the result of the operation to the user via the console.

### Functionality and Limitations

This calculator provides a basic yet functional means to perform arithmetic calculations. However, it operates solely in a console environment, limiting user interaction to text-based inputs and outputs. Additionally, it lacks error handling for scenarios such as division by zero.

### Usage

Users can execute this calculator program by running the `Calci` class, inputting two numbers, selecting an operation, and viewing the computed result in the console. Despite its simplicity, it demonstrates foundational principles of Java programming, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced calculator implementations with graphical user interfaces or enhanced functionalities.
conclusion:
In conclusion, the provided Java calculator program offers a simple yet functional tool for performing basic arithmetic operations via a console interface. By encapsulating the core arithmetic logic within the `BasicCalc` class and orchestrating user interaction through the `Calci` class, the program demonstrates fundamental principles of Java programming, including class inheritance, method invocation, user input handling, and output display.

While this calculator serves its purpose effectively within the console environment, it also highlights certain limitations. For instance, it lacks a graphical user interface (GUI), restricting user interaction to text-based inputs and outputs. Additionally, the absence of error handling mechanisms may lead to unexpected behavior, particularly in scenarios such as division by zero.

Despite these limitations, the calculator program serves as an educational resource, providing a practical example for beginners to grasp key concepts in Java programming. Furthermore, it can serve as a foundation for building more sophisticated calculator applications with enhanced functionalities, such as GUI-based interfaces, memory storage, scientific calculations, and advanced error handling.

Overall, this Java calculator program serves as a valuable learning tool, illustrating the versatility and utility of Java for developing software applications. It underscores the importance of understanding basic programming principles while laying the groundwork for more complex and feature-rich applications in the future.
